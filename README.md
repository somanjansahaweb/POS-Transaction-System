🏪 Project Overview: Cafe Management System in Python

The Cafe Management System is a Python-based program designed to manage basic operations of a café — such as taking customer orders, calculating bills, and displaying available menu items. It provides an interactive experience through the console where users can easily select items, view totals, and get their final bill.

This project efficiently demonstrates Python core programming concepts like data structures, loops, functions, and formatted outputs.

⚙️ Core Concepts Used

Dictionaries:
Used to store menu items along with their prices, enabling quick access and manipulation of data.

Sets:
Utilized for handling unique categories or items without duplication, ensuring clean data management.

Functions:
The program is modularized using functions for specific tasks such as displaying the menu, taking orders, calculating the total bill, and generating receipts — making the code reusable and easier to maintain.

Loops:
Both for and while loops are used to iterate through menu items, handle user input multiple times, and manage the ordering process efficiently.

Input Function:
Enables user interaction, allowing the café operator or customer to select menu items and quantities dynamically.

f-Strings:
Used for clean and formatted display of menu items, prices, and the final bill — improving readability and user experience.
